// a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie,
//  a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments,
//   and sets the respective class properties to these values.

class Movie{
    constructor(title,studio,rating="PG")
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = rating;
    }
}

// //b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.

class Movie{
    constructor(title,studio,rating="PG")
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = rating;
    }
}

//c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array
// of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full 
//of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full.

class Movie{
    constructor(title,studio,rating="PG")
    {
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = rating;
    }

    getPG(arr)
    {
        let return_arr = [];
        for(let i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
        {
            if(arr[i].rating=='PG')
                return_arr.push(arr[i].title);
        }
        return return_arr;
    }
}
var movies = [{title:'GUVI',studio:'PK',rating:'PG'},{title:'Tenet',studio:'PK',rating:'PG+'},{title:'Dunkirk',studio:'PK',rating:'PG'}]
var dd = new Movie('Charlie','GK Studios','PG')

console.log(dd.getPG(movies));


//d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, 
//the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

class Movie{
        constructor(title,studio,rating="PG")
        {
            this.title = title;
            this.studio = studio;
            this.rating = rating;
        }
    }
var dd = new Movie('Casino Royale','Eon Productions','PG-13')
